Drought Monitoring using GEE.
The Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI)  describes the probability of variation from the normal Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) over multiple years of data, on a weekly(or 16 day) time step. 
The EVI images are level 3 products based on data captured by MODIS. 
The SVI is calculated by taking the EVI of the pixel i during week j for year k minus the mean for pixel i during week j over n years,divided by standard deviation of pixel i during week j over n years.
